## 🧠 Project Overview

A Fintech firm is transitioning into an **AI-first strategy**. This project builds a full data science pipeline to:

- 🎯 Predict bankrupt companies
- 📊 Identify business clusters
- 🏷️ Engineer financial risk indicators
- 📉 Evaluate model performance with classification & clustering metrics
- ⚡ Deploy the full pipeline via Streamlit
